>In [Fluent Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/)shows a `+=` assignment puzzle in Python 3.10, and the author use the bytecode for expression `s[a] += b` to explain what happens under the hood. However, in new version for Python, and in my case, it is Python 3.12, the generated bytecode is different.

## Bytecode for the expression `s[a] += b`

```python
>>> dis.dis('s[a] += b')
  0           0 RESUME                   0

  1           2 LOAD_NAME                0 (s)
              4 LOAD_NAME                1 (a)
              6 COPY                     2
              8 COPY                     2
             10 BINARY_SUBSCR
             14 LOAD_NAME                2 (b)
             16 BINARY_OP               13 (+=)
             20 SWAP                     3
             22 SWAP                     2
             24 STORE_SUBSCR
             28 RETURN_CONST             0 (None)
```
